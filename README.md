Game rules!
Overall, the game is composed of several rounds, with points from each round being added up for a total score. The goal is to have the lowest possible score, as a player loses after surpassing 100 total points.

Set up:
Each player starts with 5 cards and one card from the deck is placed face up in the center. This denotes the start of the discard pile. All number cards are worth the same number of points as their number, face cards are 10 points, aces are 1 point, and jokers are a wild card. Jokers can be used to replace any card when forming a set or a straight. When the sum of all the values in the player's hand are 7 or less, they call yaniv. If the other player has less points, then they call assaf, and the yaniv-caller loses.

Moves:
The player has 3 options. They can either discard one card, make a set, or a straight. To form a set, there have to be at least 2 cards of the same value but different suites (10s, jacks, queens, kings are separate despite all being 10 points). To form a straight, at least 3 cards of the same suite in increasing order (i.e. 3H, 4H, 5H works, but not 3H, 5H, 6H). After placing a move, the player draws a card. They can either draw the top card from the deck, or the previously placed card by the other player. In the case that the opponent placed more than one card, either the top or bottom card of their move can be picked up. Drawing from the discard pile only begins after every player had their first move.

Scoring:
After each round, the losing player's score gets added to their total score count. In the case of an Assaf, the loser has the number of points in-hand +20 added to their total score. If a player hits exactly 50 points, they go back to 0 points. If someone hits exactly 100, they go down to 51. If somebody wins 3 times in a row, they lose 5 points.
